      <Section>
        The Cape Coast Christ Charismatic Center (CCC) is a vibrant Evangelical, Charismatic Christian community. Officially established on the 15th of March 2000 in Cape Coast, Ghana, our first gathering took place in a modest hall, welcoming around twenty members.

        From our inception until the year 2002, membership steadily increased to approximately two hundred adults. Early gatherings were hosted in various locations, including community centers, homes, and local venues.
